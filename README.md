# No Place Like Home
No Place Like Home is a web app for renters faced with buyout offers from their landlords. Using the latest data on property values and rent prices across the city of San Francisco, No Place Like Home gives tenants realistic estimates on how much they should get for their apartment and what they might expect to spend at an equivalent unit elsewhere in their neighborhood.

Buyout offers - often inequitable - outmatch evictions 7 to 1. Designed to fix the information imbalance between landlords and tenants, No Place Like Home is a step towards fixing some of the major housing issues San Francisco faces.


#### Technologies
Data from No Place Like Home is taken from the Zillow API. An interactive map based on the Mapbox API maps buyout data throughout the city for use by public officials and community organizations. Heroku deployment will be live by the end of the month. The app is built on a Sinatra backend with a Postgres database and a Angular frontend.
